## Introduction
MedXpert is an AI-powered application that aims to streamline healthcare processes by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The application consists of two main components:

- **Doctor's Portal:** Allows doctors to upload clinical documents, such as treatment results and X-ray images, for analysis. The application assists doctors in diagnosis and treatment planning.

- **Patient Chatbot:** Enables patients to describe their symptoms through natural language interactions. The chatbot analyzes the symptoms using NLP techniques and suggests potential diseases based on the input. Additionally, it provides recommendations for local doctors who specialize in treating the suggested diseases.
